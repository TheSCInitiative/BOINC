One thing that annoys the heck out of me is the way it allows some projects to run in high priority mode all the time never letting another app to start.  Also there should be more customization of the manager focused on more than just a priority number for a project.  No project should be able to take every CPU  for one workunit unless the user specifies that is what they want.  Some current projects will start work stealing all 20 of my CPU cores regardless of computational settings and then only use about 20% of them, thereby not using my other unused 80% of computational power because all cores show as used.
