I also added BIONIC to my home computers (laptop and PC) and let them run daily when I wasn't on them. I created a MAPP team on the grid at that point, but it ended up being futile as I left MAPP, they eventually closed MAPP and our team died except for myself.

This will help with new crunchers, and projects that have wildly varying or optimistic Initial Estimated completion times from getting more work than the system can handle till it has figured out just how much time BOINC is actually running, and how much time it's running it is processing work.
And the days of dial up and just a couple of BOINC projects are long gone.

Some people sign up to multiple projects, bump up their cache (just in case) and then stress out over why one project is getting so much preference over another etc while BOINC is trying to sort out deadlines, caches, running times of Tasks and when computing is possible.

With multiple projects and no cache, it takes a couple of days to settle down. With large caches, it can take months (especially with them continually trying to micro-manage everything).


Also, make the default values for When to suspend (Suspend should be set to not to, non-BOINC CPU usage and mouse keyboard usage left blank), Disk (use no more than 60%) and Memory (When in use/not in use set to 95%) usage less onerous and based on the hardware.
Modern desktop systems have large amounts of RAM, core/thread counts and disk storage space along with high clock speeds, so the impact of crunching is negligible in most use cases.
When installed on a mobile device the present defaults could still be used.

I’ve recommended BOINC to some tech-savvy friends, and despite their familiarity with computers, they still faced challenges from installation to project registration and starting computations.

If I were designing BOINC, I’d create a more beginner-friendly version: a BOINC client that allows users to simply open the software, select their preferred project, and start computing without the need for registration. During operation, there would be a slider to adjust how much of the computer’s resources are allocated, similar to DreamLab, but with the added option to fine-tune resource usage.

For the current BOINC version, I would consider removing the ""Simple View"" interface, as it’s not intuitive at all. Despite its name, it doesn’t feel simple, and it’s hard to figure out where to click or what to do.

I feel like some people get ""fatigued"" when it becomes open ended. People like to see the end as it were. Whether that's more detailed monthly results from the project owners about what was learned or accomplished, or even stats of work units completed vs open, that could help people see the progress they're working towards. 
Say if einstein@home had a dozen different types of projects with 10,000 work units each, launched at different times, it would be rewarding to see how far along we are in the completion of each one. Otherwise, I know I lose steam or interest when after a month or two, I just get used to my crunching going out to the ether where I forget about it.

I know my way around computers, but I don't enjoy needing to endlessly tinker with config files and drivers just to get my BOINC setup working reliably. A lot of the frustration comes from certain projects only having workunits on Linux, which creates loads of potential configuration conflicts that are absolutely miserable to try to untangle. I guess my biggest gripe with BOINC is that there's just too much troubleshooting for what should be a passive hobby.

Something that would help push past that frustration is project managers doing a better job of showing results. What are our contributions building towards? What impact have we had? Sometimes it feels like I'm just running space heaters.",

First of all, the setup needs to be much simpler. For all of my friends who I tried to convince to install BOINC : there were two possible outcomes : 
1. Do it for me, I don't understand your nerd stuff
2. Its too complicated
I am fully aware that SU exists. However, this thing has absolutely zero visibility on the Internet. Also, I think it is too far on the ""bit fat red button go brr"" spectrum. The two should be merged for the better by having a massive UI revamp. How many of my friends have stared at the UI for 5 sec before closing it forever. In my opinion, BOINC UI should integrate a fully guided setup (in the app itself not in a web UI). It has to be at the same time simple, customisable and the UI has to be good looking too (the one right now gives me Win 95 vibes). People have to be guided but aware of what they are doing. I think that this is an essential change for the future of BOINC, because evidently, as a community project, it has to target as much people as possible.
Moreover, troubleshooting and maintenance on the user's side should be as inexistent as possible. Most people just setup it and not look at it again. That is why errors and issues should be tracked down as much as possible on the dev side of things (as it is probably already the case rn).
Also, the tasks should be MUCH shorter (like 5m) with a deadline of max a day.

I actually entered the crypto community in 2016 via BOINC and Gridcoin. Bitcoin was the worse gridcoin for me back then. I now have much more knowledge in this area and still consider Gridcoin to be a very good project that is completely undervalued.

I can't understand why this project is relatively small. 

I particularly like the fact that I can decide for myself which projects I want to support and which not.

In addition, this idea offers a lot of further potential. 

Unfortunately, crypto in general is relatively unpopular in German politics and has no lobby.
