Also the web parts are incredibly antiquated and the manager interface is not intuitive.,You asked how often Boinc is run.  Many people like myself cant honestly answer that question as it varies drastically.  I go for months by doing almost 24-7 work and then months of hiatus with no work done.  Also I do 10 projects at a time for weeks to get my projects credit then I switch to the highest paid project or two for weeks to earn me cedit so I can go up in ranking.

Researchers should be able to upload their projects with a Dockerfile and have it run in more or less the same VM across any project. 

Potential BOINC projects should be given an option to set up the data aggregation parts on cloud software, so that the University only has to pay for the storage of results, and doesn't need to fund a system admin to maintain an on-premise database.

BOINC needs to figure out how to make itself relevant in the ML space. ML is a large, compute-intensive trend in academic research, and BOINC is lacking significant projects that show promise here.

BOINC publicity could use improvement; it's unclear what BOINC's plan is to market itself. The organization should take proposals, accept 1 or 2, and work to enthusiastically support.

Lastly, following David's retrospective report, BOINC needs a succession plan. This starts by having committees, elected leadership positions, etc where BOINC takes real risk by giving others significant ownership over the project so they can build the skills and knowledge to take it forward.",

It seems like it should be unnecessary to run some terminal commands (re: user groups and starting the service) after installing the package. Also -- a much bigger thing to change, but I'd love to see more public interest type computing projects available. It's frustrating when there are no work units! I run WCG, Denis, Rosetta, CPDN, and Ralph. None of the other projects interest me enough to donate cycles to. 

One more suggestion, which is also a lot to ask for: great communication from project admins and a relatively competent tech team on the project end would go a long way towards improving the user experience! Crunchers are donating something of immense value (in terms of how much it would cost, say, a university to buy equivalent computing cycles from a cloud provider) and it is discouraging when a project goes offline for days with no communication with volunteers. If the project's owners don't seem to take it seriously, why should volunteers take it seriously? If the donated computing is actually valuable, act like it. This doesn't mean that volunteers need to be paid or compensated, but that proactive communication with them should be prioritized. 

BOINC Central, for example, is a project that doesn't seem to take itself seriously in the slightest. Only one blog post up and it's a test from two years ago?!? Contrast this with the homepage of Folding@Home, which is clearly taking itself seriously, and is delivering steady work units and clear communication with its user base.

Also, I am resistant to donate money to BOINC projects. I am already donating computing, which is an ongoing commitment of both time and money. It feels like an insult to also be asked to donate to the university or other entity hosting the project. I want to know that the group I am donating computing to has at least enough stability and existing infrastructure to not need my further financial donations -- if they don't even have that, how do I have any sense they'll know how to interpret the data they get? The return on investment for project owners seems like it would be very high since the computing cycles are donated. They need to have some financial stake invested too, and as a volunteer, I want to see that. I want them to be at least as committed to their project as I am.",

A for instance;

Some project settings don't allow for certain setups using multi-threading on CPU (for example) without having to deal with an app_config.xml file (which is in the documentation, but hard to figure out for some).

This might mean some users are not crunching optimally and they don't even know it! We have BOINC account managers, so perhaps we could get some kind of unified settings manager (one app/page deals with all project settings and updates the client respectively.)",Not really! Thanks for publishing.

When people run multiple projects, if one runs out of work, but another project has work allocated to one compute resource and the project that just ran out of work was using another, that is supported by the ongoing project- the manager should be able to move it to the now available resource.

ie If a project has the supporting applications and common data, the manager should be able to move cached work allocated to the CPU to the GPU if that compute resource becomes available (and visa versa).


And the biggie that has always been a problem- a method for providing reasonably consistent Credit, across projects.
So that work done between projects can be compared with some accuracy.

Add more transparency to what exactly is being crunched and how that could help science/the world. 

Spread the word on social media. I've never seen any posts (paid or not) regarding boinc on LinkedIn or Facebook etc. 

Gamify it. Credits are cool to track, but it might gain more Traction if you could collect tokens or buy badges or something for your user profile. Use credits to buy status upgrades or enter to win some nerdy contest (zoom meeting with a researcher or a silly space/science poster). Keep users engaged. If they do a months worth of crunching and go to their rewards they can collect a ton of tokens and spend them on prizes etc. (Mostly digital prizes).

Not a fan of advertising,  but in this case I would support a tiny ad logo if it benefited science and was sleek and not annoyingly placed or trashy. Let users opt in if they want to have coca cola fund some research etc.

If all compensation is in the form of a currency that explicitly is about the progress of science then that would be a world where science is seen as the primary objective.
